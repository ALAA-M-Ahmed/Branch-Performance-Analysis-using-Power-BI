Introduction This project analyzes the performance of branches in multi-branch companies using Power BI, to help decision makers track sales, inventory, and branch efficiency. 
 The Problem
 - Which branches are most profitable? 
- Which ones have sales or inventory issues? 
- What products are top-selling in each branch?
 - When is customer demand highest or lowest? 
Steps
 1. Collect sales, inventory, and branch data
 2. Clean and prepare data in Power BI 
3. Build interactive dashboards
 4. Extract insights to support decisions
 
Insights :
1.	Top-Selling Branch ≠ Most Profitable Branch
Some branches may have high sales volume but lower profit margins due to operational costs or inventory inefficiencies. This highlights the importance of analyzing profit separately from sales.
2.	Product Preferences Vary by Branch
The best-selling products differ across branches, reflecting local customer preferences and possibly branch-specific promotions. Inventory planning should be tailored to each branch’s demand patterns.
3.	Peak Sales Times Are Not the Same for All Branches
Some branches perform best during weekends, while others peak on weekdays. Understanding these patterns helps with staffing, marketing campaigns, and operational efficiency.
4.	High Return Rates in Certain Branches
A noticeable return rate in specific branches may indicate issues related to product quality, customer service, or inaccurate demand forecasting.
5.	Uneven Inventory Distribution
Some products are overstocked in certain branches and sold out in others. This suggests the need for smarter stock reallocation instead of unnecessary restocking.
